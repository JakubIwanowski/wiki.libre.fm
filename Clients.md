**Please try and keep this list in alphabetical order.**

For each client, we'd like to know:

* Client name
* Client website if it has one
* GitHub or Libre.fm username of someone working on it (this can be added later if unknown) 
* If it supports Libre.fm directly (Y/N)
* If it requires a username/password to login
  * Some clients like Web Scrobbler will redirect you to Libre.fm to login, which would be a No in the column for this. 
  * If the app has you enter your username/password directly, please mark this Y
* Optional: If it only works over HTTP (not HTTPS)
* Optional: [[Client code]]
* Optional: Make a page about the client (see DeaDBeeF entry)

<!-- Keep URLs reasonable short, link to them if needed) -->
