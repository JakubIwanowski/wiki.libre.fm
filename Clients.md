Please try and keep this list in alphabetical order.

For each client we'd like to know:

* Client name
* Client website if it has one
* GitHub or Libre.fm username of someone working on it (this can be added later if unknown) 
* If it supports Libre.fm directly (Y/N)
* If it requires a username/password to login
* Optional: [[Client code]]
