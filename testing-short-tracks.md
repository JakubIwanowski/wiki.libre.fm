Sometimes it can be useful to test if scrobbling is working by testing a bunch of small tracks.

For this, I recommend the tracks known as _**Fingertips by They Might Be Giants from Apollo 18**_, which when bought/ripped correctly will net you a series of 21 small tracks that can be shuffled and left playing for a bit to test things.
